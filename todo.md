- [ ] `new` command should prompt for a file suffix. input field overlay?
- [ ] tags and linking!
    * tags are just `#tags` anywhere in the contents
    * when looking at a file, parse out any tags
    * do a search of all cards to find any matches for each tag, list them in right side list
    * tab over to that list to see those? maybe "quick-look" style with a modal overlay?
