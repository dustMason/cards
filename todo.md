# TODO

- [ ] `browse` single file actions 
    - [x] pbcopy
    - [x] archive
    - [x] rename
    - [ ] gist
    - [ ] run
- [ ] `new` command should prompt for a file suffix. input field overlay?
- [ ] shortcut key to open markdown file in browser? (render html to tempfile?) or somehow present?
- [ ] a solution for editing notes on mobile and syncing
- [ ] tags and linking!
    * tags are just `#tags` anywhere in the contents
    * when looking at a file, parse out any tags
    * do a search of all cards to find any matches for each tag, list them in right side list
    * tab over to that list to see those? maybe "quick-look" style with a modal overlay?
